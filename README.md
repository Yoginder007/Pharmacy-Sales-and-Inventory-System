# Pharmacy-Sales-and-Inventory-System
The Pharmacy Sales and Inventory System is a basic project that will assist pharmacy businesses in managing their drug sales and inventory. This will also assist in the tracking of expired medicinal products on hand, since the system will alert them when their supply is about to expire. And, as a result, they will check the remaining stock of the medicinal product that has expired and enter it into the system to deduct the stock count that has already been recorded for inventory management and sales product availability. This system categorizes the medicine list by the type of medicine for as well as the type of medicine such as tablet and capsule. This feature will assist the cashier in searching in detail for the product that the customer is looking for, for example, the customer is looking for a 500 mg of Amoxicillin capsule medicine that is categorized in the group of medicine used for an antibiotic but the pharmacy does not have stock of this medicine at the time. The pharmacist will simply search a product in detail and enter the term antibiotics in the search bar, which will filter the drug with available stocks in antibiotics. The pharmacist can then recommend another product that is comparable to what the customer is looking for.
